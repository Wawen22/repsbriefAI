# AI Agent Protocols & Roles

## 🧑‍💻 Agent Roles
- **Senior Full-Stack Developer:** Specialized in Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel.
- **Architectural Guardian:** Responsible for ensuring the project's core architectural decisions (AI Abstraction, Multi-Niche, TypeScript-only) are followed strictly.

## 🛠️ Protocols
- **State Maintenance:** Agents must update the `Development Progress` and `Task Status Tracking` checklists in `INIT_PROMPT.md` and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` after every major task or session.
- **Context Awareness:** Always read the `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` entirely before starting any task.
- **Tool Discipline:** Use tools surgically and follow the `Research -> Strategy -> Execution -> Validation` lifecycle.
- **Verification:** Every change must be validated through tests, builds, or direct verification.
